# Getting started

If you have a chance, please complete the following steps before 

**What you'll need:**

1. Have a web browser. We'll use Chrome, but any browser will do.
2. [Download and install SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).
3. The crash course materials. See detailed instructions below.
4. Optionally join the [crash course Slack team](https://crashcourse-invite.herokuapp.com/). Slack lets you chat with your instructor and fellow crashmates.

**The crash course materials:**

1. Download the [crash course materials](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tk14ph1pztjn4k4/weather.zip?dl=0) zip file. 
2. Extract/copy the course materials to a new directory (folder) on your computer.
3. Navigate to the folder that contains the course materials and open the directory/folder named 'before'. 
4. Open index.html in your browser. If you have trouble opening index.html, try dragging and dropping the file into an already open browser window.
5. Once you see a blue screen with white text describing the weather in Minneapolis then you're all set.

If you finish early take a moment to greet others around you. Discuss what brings you to this crash course. What do you hope to learn?
